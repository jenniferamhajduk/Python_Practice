In the next few videos about Python dictionaries, Tim demonstrates the ordering of dictionary keys changing, each time he runs the program.

That behaviour has now changed.  Since Python version 3.6, the original ordering of the keys is preserved.

That means you won't see random behaviour, when printing the dictionary keys.

The advice in the lectures is still valid: if your code relies on processing the dictionary keys in a specific order, then sort them first.

key-value pairs that are accessed by means of the key, not an index
